Work Experience
===========PostgreSQL Filesystem space issue : recently I have Filesystem space issue in pacemaker cluster. when any activity happens in Postgres db it saves all updates in archive logs format and in replication, master sends archive logs to his replica. Then replica takes update from this archive logs respectivity. but if any replica has some issue like space issue, or not reached. then the master will not send the archive logs. In this situation master saves all archives in his datadir itself, due to this the space of the san was goes full and I can't move this logs from datadir, because if i move the manually then it could be the change database goes corrupted. Now the solution was

Elaticsearchis one of our critical client and I was working there as senior engineer and there we are using ELK for real time monitoring and (by mistake our junineer) elasticsearch database has been corrupted. The client was very angry and escalated this issue to his serinors. So as a senior engineer I started working on this and approx 1 week I take to recover this. It was a very big achievement for me, because I had never worked on elasticsearch.This was a very great experience for me. After this they give me lots of work in elasticsearch. I wrote lots of grok patterns for log filtering. elasticsearch upgradating.

Spice mobile: In this project the client wants nfs db2 with nfs cluster, This is not the big task, but the main requirement was he wanted to integrate some custom scripts in the cluster and according to the Redhat not support any cluster if you not configure the cluster according to RedHat then he will not support you, but the client do not want to change his requirement. So I did that and the main challenge was to manage the sequence of cluster resources when the cluster relocated.
