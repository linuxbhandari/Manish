Jenkins
========
=> Jenkins is an open source automation tool written in Java programming language that allows continuous integration.

=> Jenkins is a powerful application that allows continuous integration and continuous delivery of projects, regardless of the platform you are working on. 

=> It is a free source that can handle any kind of build or continuous integration. You can integrate Jenkins with a number of testing and deployment technologies.

=> Jenkins builds and tests our software projects, which continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for users to obtain a fresh build.

=> Jenkins achieves CI (Continuous Integration) with the help of plugins. Plugins is used to allow the integration of various DevOps stages. If you want to integrate a particular tool, you have to install the plugins for that tool. For example: Maven 2 Project, Git, HTML Publisher, Amazon EC2, etc.


Continuous Integration?
=======================
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice in which the developers are needs to commit changes to the source code in a shared repository at regular intervals. Every commit made in the repository is then built. This allows the development teams to detect the problems early.

Continuous integration requires the developers to have regular builds. The general practice is that whenever a code commit occurs, a build should be triggered.

Advantages and Disadvantages of using Jenkins
=============================================
Advantages of Jenkins
    It is an open source tool.
    It is free of cost.
    It does not require additional installations or components. Means it is easy to install.
    Easily configurable.
    It supports 1000 or more plugins to ease your work. If a plugin does not exist, you can write the script for it and share with community.
    It is built in java and hence it is portable.
    It is platform independent. It is available for all platforms and different operating systems. Like OS X, Windows or Linux.
    Easy support, since it open source and widely used.
    Jenkins also supports cloud based architecture so that we can deploy Jenkins in cloud based platforms.

Disadvantages of Jenkins
    Its interface is out dated and not user friendly compared to current user interface trends.
    Not easy to maintain it because it runs on a server and requires some skills as server administrator to monitor its activity.
    CI regularly breaks due to some small setting changes. CI will be paused and therefore requires some developer's team attention.
